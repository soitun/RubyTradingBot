A ruby Bitcoin Trading Bot.
It currently has interfaces for Mt. Gox and CampBX.

Currently only the Mt. Gox client is implemented and uses he v2 API.
CampBX will come after I have made sure the bot makes steady gains.

There is also included a fake testing bot for the Mt. Gox client. 
It performs fake trades with variable sized wallets to test the bots profitability.
